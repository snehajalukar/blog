Hi! My name is Sneha, and this is the second post in a series of blog posts I'm writing where I summarize key takeaways from Observability Engineering, by Charity Majors, Liz Fong-Jones and George Miranda. There are 5 parts to this book, and so I'm planning on writing 5 individual posts in total - and will keep adding to each part as I progress reading.

Grab a snack, and let's continue!
